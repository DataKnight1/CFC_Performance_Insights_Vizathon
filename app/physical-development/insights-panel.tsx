        detail: "Physical testing data indicates significant improvement in sprint mechanics (17.2% increase in force production), but relative stagnation in eccentric strength capacity. Players with high eccentric strength scores show 32% better deceleration ability and 46% reduced risk of non-contact injuries.",
        action: "Implement twice-weekly eccentric-focused training blocks focusing on Nordic hamstring exercises and drop landings, particularly for players showing lower eccentric strength scores."

        title: "Movement Quality Enhancement",
        detail: "Movement screening data shows that 68% of players have suboptimal frontal plane control during change of direction movements. This correlates strongly with reduced agility performance (r=0.76) and increased risk of ankle/knee injuries.",
        action: "Incorporate movement quality assessments into daily preparation with corrective exercises for players demonstrating frontal plane deficiencies."

        title: "Positional Power Profiles",
        detail: "Comparison of power output metrics shows wide players achieving significantly higher horizontal power outputs but lower vertical power. Central defenders displaying the opposite pattern. Both profiles show position-specific performance advantages when optimized.",

Players achieving >92% of benchmark in agility tests show 26% higher technical action success rates in the final 30 minutes of matches. Pattern is most pronounced in midfielders and attacking players.",
        action: "Develop integrated physical-technical tracking to identify optimal physical development targets that directly enhance technical performance metrics under fatigue."

        title: "Force-Velocity Profiling Insights",
        detail: "Force-velocity profiling indicates 72% of the squad demonstrate force dominance vs velocity dominance. This helps explain strong aerial performance (force-dependent) but limited transition effectiveness (velocity-dependent).",
        action: "Implement individualized force-velocity profiling to guide specific training interventions targeting each player's limiting factor in power production."

        title: "Speed Development Progression Modeling",
        detail: "Longitudinal analysis of speed development shows 'responders' and 'non-responders' to current speed training methods. Responders show progressive 5-8% improvements over a season, while non-responders plateau after initial 2-3% gains.",
        action: "Create machine learning algorithm to identify response patterns to different training modalities and predict optimal stimulus type for each individual player profile."

        title: "Physical Development ROI Assessment",

        action: "Expand physical assessment technology investment with focus on velocity-based training systems showing 3:1 ROI in elite football environments."

        title: "Academy-to-First Team Physical Pathway",
        detail: "Analysis of physical development data shows significant gap between U23 and first team physical benchmarks, particularly in maximum speed (11.2% gap) and power endurance (16.8% gap). Current development pathway closes only 50% of this gap.",
        action: "Redesign academy physical development curriculum with specific benchmarks at each age group aligned with first team physical profile requirements."
      },
      {
        title: "Physical Performance Benchmarking",
        detail: "Positional analysis versus league and European competition shows our central midfielders underperforming in high-intensity endurance metrics (-9.7% vs. Champions League average) despite strong strength and power scores. Wide players show competitive speed profiles but below-average repeated sprint ability.",
        action: "Establish clear physical recruitment profiles with minimum benchmarks for each position based on both league averages and elite European competition standards."
