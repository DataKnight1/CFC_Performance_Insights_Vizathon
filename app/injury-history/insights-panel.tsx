        action: "Implement individualized high-speed exposure limits for players with hamstring injury history, with graduated exposure increasing by max 10% per week."

        title: "Optimal Return-to-Play Protocol",
        detail: "Current RTP data shows 23% reinjury rate within 2 weeks of return. Players who completed the full 5-stage rehabilitation protocol had 91% successful return compared to 62% success for accelerated returns.",

        title: "Fixture Congestion Injury Pattern",
        detail: "Injury incidence increases by 41% during periods with <72hrs between matches, with non-contact soft tissue injuries accounting for 68% of these injuries. Defensive players particularly vulnerable in the final 15 minutes of congested matches.",

        action: "Develop machine learning algorithm to predict individual injury risk based on daily loading metrics and provide automated alerts when parameters approach critical thresholds."

        title: "Sleep-Injury Connection",

        title: "Positional Injury Risk Mapping",
        detail: "Positional analysis shows center backs experience 35% more contact-related injuries, while fullbacks suffer 28% more running-related soft tissue injuries. Training load distribution indicates possible misalignment between training and positional match demands.",
